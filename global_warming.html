        <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in temperatures worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production</li>
            <li>Deforestation and land-use changes</li>
            <li>Agricultural practices that release methane and nitrous oxide</li>
            <li>Industrial processes and waste management</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consequences of Global Warming</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rising sea levels due to melting polar ice caps and glaciers</li>
            <li>Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts, floods)</li>
            <li>Loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystems</li>
            <li>Negative impacts on agriculture and food security</li>
            <li>Health risks from heatwaves and the spread of diseases</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <p>To combat global warming, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through various strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro)</li>
            <li>Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry</li>
            <li>Reforestation and afforestation efforts</li>
            <li>Sustainable agricultural practices</li>
            <li>International cooperation and policy-making (e.g., Paris Agreement)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Addressing global warming requires collective action from individuals, communities, governments, and businesses worldwide. By adopting sustainable practices and reducing our carbon footprint, we can help mitigate the effects of global warming and protect our planet for future generations.</p>
